/**
 * Which of a resolved source's mapped columns the physical table actually has.

 * A MAPPING IS A DESCRIPTION, NOT A GUARANTEE. EntityMappingSeeder deliberately
 * writes a candidate's whole field list — including the optional fields a
 * particular deployment's copy of the table happens not to carry — because the
 * description must not depend on which connection ran the seeder. That is the
 * right call at describe time and it leaves exactly one question open at read
 * time: is the column there?
 *
 * Asking it here rather than at each call site is what keeps an optional
 * profile column (an ERP that records `website` and one that does not) from
 * turning a working Organization screen into a SQL error. It is only ever used
 * to NARROW a mapped set — never to guess a column that was not mapped — so it
 * cannot become the fallback EntityResolver exists to forbid.
 *
 * Scoped per request for the same reason as EntityResolver: schemas change
 * under a long-lived worker, and one request asks the same table the same
 * question several times.
