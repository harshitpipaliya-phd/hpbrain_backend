/**
 * Ingestion, on top of the import tables that already exist.
 *
 * WHY NO `ingestion_runs` TABLE. hpbrain_import_jobs and hpbrain_import_logs
 * already model exactly this: a run with row counts, per-row outcomes, an error
 * report and rollback data, plus nine live /api/v1/imports/* routes and two
 * repositories on top of them. A second runs table would have meant two
 * half-populated histories, two rollback paths, and a UI that had to ask which
 * kind of import it was looking at before it could show anything. Three
 * nullable columns is the whole cost of reusing what is there.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY NEW. Only the source registry — the thing import_jobs has
 * no concept of. A job says what happened; a data source says where it can
 * happen again, and holds the checkpoint that makes the next run incremental
 * rather than a re-import of everything.
 *
 * TENANT_ID IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE. Every hpbrain_ table carries it and every
 * read goes through BaseRepository::scoped(). A source registry without it
 * would let one tenant's configured source be listed, edited, or run by
 * another — and because a source names ERP tables, running someone else's
 * source is a cross-tenant read, not a display bug.
 *
 * IDs ARE VARCHAR(36), NOT AUTO-INCREMENT. Everything these rows will ever join
 * to — import jobs, signals, evidence, event-store entity ids — is a UUID
 * string. A BIGINT here would have to be cast at every join.
 *
 * GUARDED THROUGHOUT. This migration runs against a database the institute ERP
 * shares, and ALTER TABLE is not idempotent the way CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
 * is. Every statement below checks first, so a re-run is a no-op rather than
 * SQLSTATE 42S21.
