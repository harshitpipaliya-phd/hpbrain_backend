/**
 * Turn hpbrain_students from an identity list into a read model.
 *
 * WHY THIS TABLE EXISTS AT ALL. Lions' academic export is 388,401 rows, and
 * every one of them is an EXAM RESULT — one subject, one exam, one year, for one
 * student. Treating a row as a person would publish 388,401 people for a school
 * with roughly five thousand. The rows are already stored correctly, as
 * operational records; what was missing is the student, which the export never
 * states directly and which has to be derived by collapsing the rows on
 * enrollment_no.
 *
 * The fee export is the same shape on the other axis: 10,430 receipts against
 * 4,052 GR numbers. `academic.enrollment_no = fees."GR NO."` is the only join
 * the two files support — the names are not reliable keys and are not used.
 *
 * WHY THE COUNTS ARE STORED RATHER THAN JOINED. The People screen shows a page
 * of students with their record counts and paid totals. Computing those per row
 * means a correlated aggregate over a 388k-row table for every student on the
 * page; doing it once per rebuild means the screen is a single indexed range
 * scan. These columns are a projection of hpbrain_operational_records and are
 * rebuilt from it by `students:rebuild` — they are derived, never entered, and
 * never a source of truth. Nothing here invents a student who is not in a file.
 *
 * WHY in_academic / in_fees. The two exports overlap only partially, and the
 * overlap is the single most important fact about this dataset: a student in
 * both files can have academic and fee information related, and a student in
 * only one cannot. Storing the two flags makes "matched", "fee-only" and
 * "result-only" an indexed count instead of a full-outer-join every time the
 * question is asked, and it stops the UI implying a relationship that the data
 * does not support.
 *
 * WHY academic_standard IS SEPARATE FROM standard. The files disagree, and
 * neither is wrong: the fee export says "IX", the academic export says "CBSE-2".
 * They are different vocabularies recorded four years apart. Collapsing them
 * into one column would force a fake reconciliation, so both are kept and
 * labelled by origin.
 *
 * ADDITIVE AND IDEMPOTENT. Only ADD COLUMN / ADD INDEX on a table this codebase
 * introduced, each guarded by a presence check, so re-running is safe and no
 * existing column is altered or dropped.
