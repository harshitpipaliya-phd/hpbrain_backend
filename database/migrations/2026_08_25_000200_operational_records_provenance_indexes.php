/**
 * The three provenance columns the dataset profile counts distinct values of.
 *
 * OrganizationDataProfiler::dataset() asks three questions about where a
 * dataset came from, and each is a COUNT(DISTINCT …) scoped to one tenant and
 * one dataset:
 *
 *   source_file     → how many files this dataset was assembled from
 *   import_job_id   → how many import runs contributed to it
 *   natural_key     → distinct subjects, whose shortfall against the row count
 *                     is the duplication figure the gap detector reports
 *
 * None had an index a tenant-scoped count could use. `natural_key` looks
 * covered — there is a unique index carrying it — but it sits third in that
 * index, and a count filtered by tenant_id and dataset cannot use a prefix it
 * does not lead. Measured on the development database, one tenant's 27,000-row
 * dataset: COUNT(DISTINCT source_file) took 143 seconds on its own.
 *
 * SEPARATE FROM THE MEASURE INDEXES BESIDE IT, and deliberately so. Each ALTER
 * on this table runs for several minutes against a remote database; splitting
 * the work means an operator who has to stop halfway leaves the migrations
 * table telling the truth about what has been applied, rather than one entry
 * that may or may not have finished.
 *
 * EXPECT THIS ONE TO TAKE A WHILE. Three index builds over the whole table,
 * roughly seven minutes each on the development database. It is safe to
 * interrupt and re-run: an index already present is skipped.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT AND MYSQL-ONLY, matching every other index migration here — the
 * suite runs on SQLite, where these buy nothing and the information_schema
 * probe does not exist.
