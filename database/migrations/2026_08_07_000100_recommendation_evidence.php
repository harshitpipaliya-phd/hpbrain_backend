/**
 * Links a recommendation to the specific evidence rows it was reasoned from.
 *
 * WHY A JOIN TABLE AND NOT AN evidence_refs JSON COLUMN. The relationship is
 * genuinely many-to-many — one evidence row (a single department missing its
 * manager) supports every recommendation drawn from that signal, and one
 * recommendation rests on many evidence rows. A JSON array of ids on
 * hpbrain_recommendations would express the same fact in a form nothing can
 * join against, index, or check for referential integrity, and the ids inside
 * it would rot silently when evidence is superseded.
 *
 * The shape is copied from hpbrain_case_evidence, which already solves exactly
 * this problem for cases: (tenant_id, <parent>_id, evidence_id, linked_date),
 * composite primary key, no surrogate id. Matching it means the two link tables
 * can be reasoned about — and queried — the same way, rather than each having
 * its own dialect.
 *
 * Raw DDL rather than Schema-builder calls, for the reasons stated at the head
 * of 2026_01_01_001200_decision_intelligence.php: VARCHAR(36) keys because
 * MySQL rejects TEXT in a key (error 1170), and the hpbrain_ prefix because the
 * Brain shares a database with the institute ERP.
