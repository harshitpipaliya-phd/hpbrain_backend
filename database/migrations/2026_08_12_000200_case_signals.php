/**
 * Many signals per case, without disturbing the one that is already there.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY WRONG TODAY. hpbrain_cases.signal_id is a single nullable
 * column, so a case can name exactly one signal. A signal may already carry
 * several cases — neither index on that column is unique — so the relationship
 * is many-to-one, and the closed direction is precisely the one an aggregate
 * finding needs: several related signals investigated as one problem.
 *
 * WHY THE COLUMN IS KEPT, AND KEPT AUTHORITATIVE. Seven call sites read
 * hpbrain_cases.signal_id, two of them inside ExplainVerb's hypothesis join —
 * the query the whole EXPLAIN → RECOMMEND path depends on and which is proven
 * by GoldenIntelligenceFlowTest. Replacing the column would rewrite a verb that
 * is currently correct in order to add a capability nothing yet consumes. So
 * this migration is additive only: the column remains the case's PRIMARY signal
 * and every existing reader keeps its present meaning, while the junction
 * carries the additional ones.
 *
 * NO DATA IS MOVED, ONLY COPIED. Nothing writes to or drops hpbrain_cases, and
 * down() drops only the new table. The 19 existing links cannot be lost by
 * running this, by re-running it, or by reversing it.
 *
 * `role` DISTINGUISHES THE ORIGINAL LINK FROM LATER ONES. Without it the only
 * way to answer "which signal was this case opened for?" is to join back to
 * hpbrain_cases.signal_id — the coupling this table exists to relieve. The
 * backfill marks every copied row 'primary'; anything attached afterwards is
 * 'related' unless a caller says otherwise.
 *
 * NOT ENFORCED, DELIBERATELY: "at most one primary per case". MariaDB has no
 * partial unique index, and the generated-column trick that emulates one
 * (UNIQUE over IF(role='primary', case_id, NULL)) buys a constraint at the cost
 * of a column no reader understands. The invariant belongs in the code that
 * attaches signals, where it can also say why it refused.
