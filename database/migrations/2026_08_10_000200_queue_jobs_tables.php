/**
 * The framework queue tables.
 *
 * WHY THEY WERE MISSING. .env sets QUEUE_CONNECTION=database, but this project
 * has no config/queue.php and never ran `queue:table`, so the connection was
 * configured and unprovisioned: dispatching anything would have failed with
 * "Base table or view not found: hpbrain… jobs". Nothing dispatched, so nobody
 * noticed. Ingestion is the first caller that genuinely needs a worker — a
 * 162,810-row commit is minutes of work and cannot sit inside a request.
 *
 * STANDARD LARAVEL SCHEMA, unmodified. These are framework-owned tables read by
 * the queue worker itself; deviating from the expected column set breaks
 * `queue:work`. They deliberately do NOT carry a tenant_id: a queue row is
 * infrastructure, and the tenant lives inside the serialised job payload where
 * the job's own constructor put it. Tenant isolation is enforced where it has
 * always been enforced — in the service the job calls, against the tenant id
 * the job was created with.
