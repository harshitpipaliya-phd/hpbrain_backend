/**
 * Two indexes for the academic-result query patterns.
 *
 * hpbrain_operational_records already carries tenant-leading composites for
 * every axis the fee datasets are read along:
 *
 *   (tenant_id, dataset, occurred_at)   year-wise
 *   (tenant_id, dataset, status)        standard-wise
 *   (tenant_id, dataset, subject_ref)   student-wise
 *   (tenant_id, dataset, owner_name)    collector-wise
 *   (tenant_id, dataset, zone)
 *
 * The academic dataset added two more axes and neither was covered. Both are
 * GROUP BY targets on 388,401 rows for one tenant, so without an index each
 * report is a full scan of that tenant's slice:
 *
 *   category      → subject-wise average percentage
 *   sub_category  → exam-wise average percentage
 *
 * WHY THESE TWO AND NOT MORE. Every index costs write time on an import that
 * already inserts hundreds of thousands of rows, so this adds only the columns
 * with a real query behind them. `standard` needed nothing — it maps to
 * `status`, which is already indexed. `syear` needed nothing — it maps to
 * `occurred_at`, likewise. The redundant single-column tenant indexes on
 * hpbrain_signals / _evidence / _cases are left alone: they are wasteful
 * prefixes of wider composites, but dropping an index is a separate decision
 * from adding one and does not belong in the same migration.
 *
 * TENANT FIRST, THEN DATASET, THEN THE COLUMN — matching every other index on
 * this table and the shape of every query that reads it. A leading `category`
 * would be useless: nothing queries categories across tenants, and nothing may.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT AND MYSQL-ONLY. The suite runs on SQLite where these indexes buy
 * nothing and the information_schema probe does not exist, so it returns early
 * there. Re-running is safe: an index already present is skipped rather than
 * failing the migration.
