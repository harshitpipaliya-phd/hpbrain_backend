/**
 * Record whether a student is on the ERP's own roster.
 *
 * WHY A THIRD FLAG BESIDE in_academic AND in_fees. Those two say which IMPORTED
 * FILE a student appears in, and until now a student could only exist because
 * one of them named them. That makes the projection a picture of what has been
 * exported rather than of who is enrolled: a school with eight thousand
 * children on its register and no results export publishes zero students, and
 * the Departments, Analytics and Intelligence screens beneath it are all
 * correctly empty for a reason no reader can see.
 *
 * `in_roster` is the answer to a different question — "is this child on the
 * school's register" — and it has to be stored separately for the same reason
 * in_academic and in_fees are separate from each other: a student on the roster
 * with no results is a real and common state, and so is a student in an
 * historical results export who has since left. Collapsing them would lose
 * which of those two a row is.
 *
 * NOTHING IS BACKFILLED. Existing rows get 0, which is the truth about them:
 * they were derived from imported files, and whether the ERP also lists them is
 * a fact the next `students:rebuild` establishes rather than one this migration
 * may assume. An installation whose ERP has no student roster never sets it,
 * and every count it already publishes is unchanged.
 *
 * ADDITIVE AND IDEMPOTENT, in the same shape as the projection-columns
 * migration beside it: ADD COLUMN / ADD INDEX on a Brain-owned table, each
 * guarded by a presence check.
