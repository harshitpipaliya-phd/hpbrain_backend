/**
 * Daily metric snapshots — the Brain's memory of its own numbers.
 *
 * Every figure the system produced was instantaneous. It could say "42 open
 * signals" and never "42, down from 61 last week", so no screen could show
 * MOVEMENT and the Intelligence Score could not be told from a coin-flip that
 * happened to land on 62 twice.
 *
 * value is DECIMAL(18,4) and confidence DECIMAL(6,4). An unqualified NUMERIC
 * becomes DECIMAL(10,0) on MySQL and would round every confidence to an integer.
 *
 * value IS NULLABLE AND THAT IS THE POINT. A metric with no denominator — a
 * reuse rate on a tenant with no learnings, a deficit with no assessments — is
 * stored as NULL, not 0. A reuse rate of null is not a reuse rate of zero, and a
 * time series that silently converts one to the other draws a flat line at the
 * bottom of the chart and calls it a measurement.
 *
 * sample_n is what lets a reader tell a rate of 1.0 over two cases from the same
 * rate over two hundred.
