/**
 * Signal rules, as rows.
 *
 * The five rules were private methods on SignalGenerator. Adding a sixth meant a
 * deploy; giving a hospital a different sixth meant a conditional. As rows they
 * are configuration, and `industry_code` lets a rule be shipped to every tenant
 * in an industry without naming one.
 *
 * PREDICATES ARE JSON, NOT SQL, AND THAT IS NOT NEGOTIABLE. A rule row is
 * user-supplied data — an administrator writes it through the API. If the
 * predicate reached the query planner as text, that administrator would have the
 * database. The grammar in RuleEvaluator has a closed operator set and every
 * value is bound; identifiers come from EntityResolver, never from the rule.
 * There is deliberately no raw-SQL escape hatch, because an escape hatch is used
 * exactly once and then relied upon.
 *
 * confidence is DECIMAL(6,4) and threshold_value DECIMAL(18,4). NUMERIC without
 * precision becomes DECIMAL(10,0) on MySQL, which would silently round every
 * confidence to an integer — 0.8 stored as 1.
