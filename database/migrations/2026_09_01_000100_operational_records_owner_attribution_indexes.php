/**
 * The second way a record names its department: through the person who handled it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `department_label` (2026_08_30_000100) reads the owning unit the
 * source export STATED. That is authoritative where it is present, and on this ERP
 * it is absent for a third of the rows — Fiber Valley's 16,505 `job_order` records
 * carry no department at all. They are not unattributable: every one of their nine
 * distinct `owner_name` values is a person on the CST - FVCPL roster, so the work
 * belongs to that unit as certainly as if the export had said so.
 *
 * That is a DIFFERENT attribution basis, not a fuzzier version of the same one, and
 * DepartmentWorkAttribution publishes it as such — "work handled by this unit's
 * people" beside "work booked to this unit's name". Neither is inferred from the
 * other and the screen says which one a figure came from.
 *
 * WHAT THESE INDEXES ARE FOR. Owner attribution means `owner_name IN (<the unit's
 * roster>)`, and the existing (tenant_id, dataset, owner_name) index stops exactly
 * one column short of every question worth asking of it. MEASURED ON THE LIVE
 * DATABASE, tenant 1000018, the nine owners of `job_order`:
 *
 *     GROUP BY status                      92.0s  ->  covered by ..._owner_status
 *     AVG(closed_at - occurred_at)         80.9s  ->  covered by ..._owner_time
 *
 * Both were reading `status` and `closed_at` off the clustered index, where each
 * row drags its inline `payload` longtext through the buffer pool. Extending the
 * index by the columns the aggregate selects is the whole fix; it is the same
 * lesson as OperationalIntelligence::fieldSupportPerDataset(), applied to the owner
 * axis instead of the dataset axis.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT AND MYSQL-ONLY, like every index migration beside it: the test suite
 * runs on SQLite, where these buy nothing and the information_schema probe does not
 * exist.
