/**
 * Give every fractional column a scale. Twenty-seven of them had none.
 *
 * THIS IS THE BUG THAT MADE THE PRODUCT LOOK BROKEN.
 *
 * An unqualified NUMERIC/DECIMAL in MySQL and MariaDB means DECIMAL(10,0) —
 * ten digits, ZERO of them after the point. Every value written to such a
 * column is rounded to a whole number on the way in. Measured against the live
 * database before this migration:
 *
 *     INSERT 0.85, 0.30, 0.49, 0.78  ->  SELECT 1, 0, 0, 1
 *
 * Every confidence score in the Brain was one of those columns. So were the
 * five KASBA levels, evidence confidence, risk probability, and reasoning step
 * confidence. Confidence is not decoration here — it is the number that decides
 * whether a claim may be shown at all, which band it renders in, and whether a
 * policy gate opens. Reduced to a coin flip, every screen that displays it is
 * either overstating certainty (0.51 -> 1.00) or destroying a real finding
 * (0.49 -> 0.00), with no way to tell which from the stored value.
 *
 * It also silently defeats the confidence ceiling: a system designed never to
 * claim more than 0.95 certainty was storing 1.
 *
 * WHY IT SURVIVED. These tables predate this repository's migrations — they
 * come from the older schema tracked in hpbrain_schema_migrations. The test
 * suite builds its own schema on SQLite, where DECIMAL is advisory and 0.85
 * round-trips as 0.85 regardless of the declared scale. Nothing in the suite
 * could see this, and nothing in it can regress it either; the guard is the
 * assertion in PrecisionTest, which checks the declared scale rather than a
 * round-trip.
 *
 * ALREADY-WRITTEN DATA CANNOT BE RECOVERED. A stored 1 might have been 0.51 or
 * 0.99. This migration widens the column so future writes are faithful; it does
 * not invent history. Affected rows at the time of writing: one signal and two
 * hypotheses, all reading exactly 1. Those want recomputing from their evidence,
 * not back-filling with a guess.
 *
 * The scale chosen per column follows what the value MEANS, not one blanket
 * type — see GROUPS below.
