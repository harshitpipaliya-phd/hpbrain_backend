/**
 * Add the two columns DataSourceRepository has always written and the table has
 * never had.
 *
 * THE DRIFT. 2026_08_06_000100_ingestion_data_sources created
 * hpbrain_data_sources with (id, tenant_id, source_key, display_name,
 * source_type, config, is_active, last_synced_at, created_by, created_date,
 * updated_date). DataSourceRepository — written afterwards — reads and writes
 * `field_map` and `checkpoint`, which are in neither the migration nor the live
 * database.
 *
 * HOW IT STAYED HIDDEN. Only two paths touch those columns: saveFieldMap(),
 * reached when an ingestion commit is sent with save_map = true, and the
 * checkpoint update on the internal ERP source. Every ingestion commit against
 * the live database therefore died with
 *
 *     SQLSTATE[42S22]: Unknown column 'field_map' in 'field list'
 *
 * — but only AFTER writing all its signals and evidence, so the failure looked
 * like a 500 at the end of a long request rather than a missing column. On this
 * remote database the commit was also exceeding the 60-second execution limit
 * before it ever got that far, which masked the error entirely: the timeout was
 * reported instead. Fixing the per-row round trips is what surfaced it.
 *
 * NOT STORED INSIDE `config`. Folding them into the existing JSON column would
 * avoid a migration, but the repository's list()/find() project `field_map` as
 * a first-class column and its jsonColumns() declares it decodable; making it a
 * nested key would require changing four methods to work around a schema the
 * code already assumes. Two nullable columns is the smaller, more honest edit.
 *
 * SAFETY. Both steps are guarded, so running this against a database that
 * already has either column is a metadata read and nothing else. The table is
 * Brain-owned (hpbrain_ prefix); no ERP table is touched.
