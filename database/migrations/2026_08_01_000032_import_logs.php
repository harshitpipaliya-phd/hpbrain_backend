/**
 * `row_number` IS BACKTICKED BECAUSE IT IS A RESERVED WORD.
 *
 * MariaDB 10.2 and MySQL 8.0 both introduced the ROW_NUMBER() window function
 * and reserved the identifier. Unquoted, this CREATE TABLE fails with
 *
 *     SQLSTATE[42000]: 1064 ... near 'row_number INT, action VARCHAR(50) ...'
 *
 * and because migrations stop at the first failure, it took the FIFTEEN
 * migrations after it down with it — including every table added in Phases 3
 * to 5. The suite never caught it: it builds its schema by hand on SQLite,
 * where row_number is an ordinary word.
 *
 * Found by running the migrations against a real MariaDB 10.11 instance, which
 * is the only place this bug exists.
