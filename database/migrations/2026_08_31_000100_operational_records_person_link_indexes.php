/**
 * The indexes a person's profile is read through.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE DEFECT THIS FIXES
 *
 * Opening one person took minutes, and the whole cost was one query. A person is
 * linked to imported records by three columns — the reference the record names,
 * who handled it, and who supervised it — and the profile asked for all three at
 * once:
 *
 *     WHERE tenant_id = ?
 *       AND (subject_ref = ? OR owner_name = ? OR supervisor_name = ?)
 *
 * No single index can serve an OR across three different columns, so the
 * optimizer abandoned all of them and read 335,856 rows off the clustered index,
 * each one dragging its inline JSON payload through the buffer pool.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THE EXISTING INDEXES DID NOT HELP
 *
 * There already are `(tenant_id, dataset, owner_name)` and its two siblings, and
 * they look like they cover this. They cannot: `dataset` sits BETWEEN the tenant
 * and the name, and the profile does not filter on a dataset — it wants every
 * dataset this person appears in. A gap in the middle of a composite key ends
 * the seek, so `owner_name` is reduced to a filter applied while scanning all
 * 335,856 of the tenant's index entries. Measured on Fiber Valley:
 *
 *     zero-match lookup, existing index      3,767 ms   ← the scan alone
 *     15,116-match lookup, + occurred_at    92,150 ms   ← plus row lookups
 *
 * The first number is the tell. It is the cost of finding NOTHING, so it is pure
 * scan, and no amount of narrowing the result could have reduced it.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT THESE ARE
 *
 * `(tenant_id, <link column>, dataset, occurred_at)` — the same columns, in the
 * order this query actually uses them. The name becomes a seek key rather than a
 * filter, and `dataset` and `occurred_at` follow it so the per-dataset rollup
 * (count, first seen, last seen) is answered from the index without touching a
 * row. That is what removes the 92-second half: the row lookups were only ever
 * needed because `occurred_at` was not in the index.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT AND MYSQL-ONLY, matching the index migrations beside it. SQLite has
 * no ALTER ... ADD INDEX of this form and the test schema does not need one.
 *
 * A BOUNDED LOCK WAIT, for the reason written out in the department_label
 * migration: a blocked ALTER parks at the head of the metadata-lock queue and
 * every later query queues behind it, which takes the application down rather
 * than merely delaying the migration. Ten seconds, then give up and say so.
 * Re-running picks up whatever is still missing.
