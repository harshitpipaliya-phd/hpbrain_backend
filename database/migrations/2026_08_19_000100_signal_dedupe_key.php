/**
 * Make the database, not a convention, the thing that refuses a duplicate
 * ingested signal.
 *
 * WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE. hpbrain_operational_records has carried
 * UNIQUE (tenant_id, dataset, natural_key) since it was created, and that is why
 * the 398,831 imported Lions rows contain no duplicate receipts. hpbrain_signals
 * had no equivalent: its only protection was that IngestionService derived the
 * primary key deterministically. That derivation included the file's row NUMBER,
 * so two exports containing the same record produced two ids and two rows, and
 * nothing at the storage layer objected. On tenant 1000010 the fee source holds
 * 10,430 signals against 10,376 distinct external references.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ADDS.
 *   dedupe_key CHAR(64) NULL — the business identity of an ingested row:
 *   sha256(sourceKey | external_ref | title | owner | state), each part
 *   trimmed, whitespace-collapsed and case-folded. Written by
 *   IngestionService::dedupeKey(); see businessIdentity() there for why the
 *   external reference ALONE is not the identity (tenant 1000010's fee export
 *   carries receipt 4707 for two different children).
 *
 *   UNIQUE (tenant_id, dedupe_key) — tenant first, because that is the column
 *   every read already filters on and a duplicate is only ever a duplicate
 *   WITHIN one organization. Two schools may both hold a student 10821 and they
 *   remain two rows, permanently.
 *
 * WHY NULLABLE, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A LOOPHOLE. MySQL permits repeated NULLs in
 * a unique index. Signals raised by rules or entered by hand are not "the same
 * fact observed again" and have no business key to compute; they stay NULL and
 * are unaffected. Only ingested rows claim identity, and among those the
 * constraint is absolute.
 *
 * THE INDEX IS ADDED ONLY WHEN THE DATA CAN CARRY IT. Existing duplicates would
 * make CREATE UNIQUE INDEX fail, and the correct response to that is to
 * consolidate them — deliberately, with their evidence and case links
 * repointed — not to drop the constraint so the migration passes. So this
 * migration backfills what it safely can, adds the index if the result is
 * clean, and otherwise leaves the column in place and says exactly which
 * command to run:
 *
 *     php artisan brain:dedupe-signals --tenant=<id>          (dry run)
 *     php artisan brain:dedupe-signals --tenant=<id> --apply
 *
 * Re-running this migration after that cleanup adds the index. It is written to
 * be re-runnable for that reason.

     *
     * IT IS DERIVABLE, AND THAT IS WHY THE IDENTITY IS THE MAPPED FIELDS. Every
     * component was already recorded: metadata.provenance.sourceKey,
     * metadata.externalRef, metadata.title, metadata.owner, and the state in
     * `classification`. Had the identity been a hash of the raw source row, no
     * backfill would have been possible at all — the row is not in the database
     * — and every pre-existing import would have been invisible to the
     * constraint.
     *
     * THE SQL MIRRORS canonicalToken() EXACTLY, and must keep doing so: LOWER
     * of TRIM of REGEXP_REPLACE(…, '\\s+', ' '). A backfilled key that differs
     * from the one the service computes would be worse than no key — the
     * re-import would not match, and the row would be written twice with two
     * different keys.
     *
     * JSON null READS BACK AS THE STRING 'null'. JSON_UNQUOTE of a JSON null is
     * the four characters n-u-l-l, not SQL NULL, so `IS NOT NULL` does not
     * filter it — on tenant 7 that turned 351 distinct observations into one
     * identity. It is normalised to the empty string here, exactly as the
     * service canonicalises an absent mapped field to ''.
