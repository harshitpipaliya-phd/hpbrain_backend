/**
 * The two measure columns the data profiler sorts and groups on.
 *
 * hpbrain_operational_records carries a tenant-leading composite for every axis
 * that is READ along — occurred_at, status, zone, owner_name, subject_ref,
 * category, sub_category. The two the profiler MEASURES along were the only
 * ones with nothing behind them:
 *
 *   metric_value  → ORDER BY, for the median and the 95th percentile
 *   metric_unit   → GROUP BY, for the dataset's dominant unit
 *
 * MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. Against the development database, for one tenant's
 * 27,000-row school_fee dataset:
 *
 *   WHERE tenant_id = ?                              0.26s
 *   WHERE tenant_id = ? AND dataset = ?              0.72s
 *   … GROUP BY metric_unit ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC  118.96s
 *   … ORDER BY metric_value LIMIT 1 OFFSET n       129.99s
 *
 * The filter is instant and the sort is two minutes, which is the signature of
 * a filesort over the matched slice with no index to walk. Every organization's
 * intelligence is recomputed through that path whenever its data changes, so
 * two minutes per dataset is the difference between a profile that completes
 * inside a request and one that does not.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS WORTH THE WRITE COST. Every index slows an import that already
 * inserts hundreds of thousands of rows, so the bar for adding one is a real
 * query. These two have the same query — profileDataset() — running for every
 * dataset of every tenant, on the path that produces the product's headline
 * numbers.
 *
 * TENANT FIRST, THEN DATASET, THEN THE COLUMN, matching every other index on
 * this table. A leading metric_value would be useless: nothing reads
 * measurements across tenants, and nothing may.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT AND MYSQL-ONLY, for the same reasons as the category indexes
 * beside it: the suite runs on SQLite, where these buy nothing and the
 * information_schema probe does not exist.
