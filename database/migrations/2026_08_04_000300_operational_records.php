/**
 * ONE new table. No ALTER on anything that already exists.
 *
 * WHY A TABLE AT ALL
 * ------------------
 * The Brain reads Organization / Department / Person live from the ERP and owns
 * everything it reasons WITH (docs/ERP-TO-BRAIN-MAPPING.md). FiberValley's
 * workbooks are neither: a complaint ticket is not a Person, and forcing 65,268
 * of them into tbluser would corrupt the master-data semantics every other
 * organization depends on. They are operational facts the Brain reasons over,
 * so by the existing rule they belong in an hpbrain_* table.
 *
 * WHY GENERIC RATHER THAN hpbrain_fibervalley_complaints
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * A per-organization table is a new subsystem by another name — it needs its
 * own repository, its own rules, its own migration every time a workbook shape
 * changes. This table is keyed by (tenant_id, dataset) and carries the columns
 * that operational records of ANY kind share: when it happened, when it closed,
 * who owned it, who supervised, where, what state, one metric. Anything
 * dataset-specific lives in `payload`. FiberValley's five datasets fit it, and
 * so does the next organization's, without further DDL.
 *
 * WHY THESE COLUMNS ARE PROMOTED OUT OF payload
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * Exactly the ones the signal rules filter and group by. JSON extraction cannot
 * use an index in MySQL 8 without a generated column, and the complaint rules
 * group 65k rows by zone and by month on every evaluation. Everything the rules
 * only ever display — subscriber id, remarks, POP, junction box — stays in
 * payload where it costs nothing.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY
 * -----------
 * UNIQUE (tenant_id, dataset, natural_key) is the whole re-import story. The
 * same workbook imported twice updates in place; next month's larger export
 * inserts only what is new. row_hash lets the loader skip a row whose content
 * has not changed at all, which turns a re-run of an unchanged 65k-row sheet
 * into 65k cheap comparisons instead of 65k writes.
 *
 * KEY LENGTH: 36 + 64 + 191 = 291 chars. At utf8mb4's 4 bytes that is 1,164
 * bytes, inside InnoDB's 3,072-byte limit for DYNAMIC row format. natural_key
 * is 191 rather than 255 for exactly this reason — the longest real key in the
 * FiberValley data is a 10-character ticket number, so nothing is lost.
