/**
 * hpbrain_data_sources — the tenant's configured ingestion sources.
 *
 * WHY A NEW TABLE RATHER THAN AN ALTER ON `data_sources`.
 * The existing `data_sources` table has two defects recorded in
 * docs/API-FUNCTIONAL-AUDIT.md, and neither is fixable by adding a column:
 *
 *   1. IT IS UNPREFIXED. This installation shares its database with the
 *      institute ERP, which is the entire reason every other table in this
 *      application carries the hpbrain_ prefix. A bare `data_sources` is a
 *      name collision waiting for the ERP to want the same word.
 *
 *   2. IT HAS NO tenant_id. Every repository in this application scopes by
 *      tenant through BaseRepository::scoped(); a table without the column
 *      cannot participate, and GET /ingestion/sources/{tenantId} would have
 *      had to answer with every tenant's sources or none.
 *
 * RENAMING IN PLACE WOULD BE THE TIDIER STORY AND IS THE WRONG ONE: a rename
 * plus an ALTER on a table that another deployment may already be writing to
 * is a migration that can half-apply. Both `data_sources` and `ingestion_runs`
 * hold ZERO rows on this installation (verified 2026-08-06), so there is
 * nothing to carry across and this table starts clean.
 *
 * THE OLD TABLES ARE DELIBERATELY NOT DROPPED. The audit's instruction was to
 * verify before removing, and a migration that drops a table it did not create
 * removes the only evidence of what was there. Dropping them is a separate,
 * reversible decision once nothing references them.
 *
 * source_key, NOT source_id. It is the name the client's DataSourceRow
 * declares (web/src/api/ingestion.ts), and `source_id` beside a VARCHAR(36)
 * `id` on the same row reads as a foreign key to something.
