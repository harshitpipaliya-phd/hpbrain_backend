/**
 * Indexes on the ERP tables the Brain reads on every screen.
 *
 * THESE TABLES ARE NOT OURS. tbluser, hrms_departments, institute_detail,
 * org_details and tbluserprofilemaster belong to the institute ERP, which
 * shares this database. No migration in this project creates them and none has
 * ever indexed them — but the Brain queries tbluser from roughly thirty call
 * sites, and every one of them filters on sub_institute_id or email. Without an
 * index those are full table scans, repeated on every login and every load of
 * the people and dashboard screens.
 *
 * BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT OURS, THIS MIGRATION IS DELIBERATELY TIMID:
 *
 *   1. It only ever CREATEs. It never drops, alters or reorders anything.
 *   2. It skips any table it cannot find, and any index naming a column that
 *      does not exist — the ERP schema may differ from what we expect.
 *   3. It skips when the LEADING COLUMN IS ALREADY INDEXED, under any name.
 *      On a table another system owns, a redundant index is not free: it costs
 *      disk and slows every INSERT and UPDATE the ERP makes. If sub_institute_id
 *      is already indexed, the scan problem is already solved and a marginally
 *      better composite is not worth imposing a second index on someone else's
 *      write path.
 *   4. Each statement is individually guarded, so one failure cannot abort the
 *      others.
 *
 * OPERATIONAL NOTE. CREATE INDEX takes a lock while it builds. On MySQL 8 that
 * is an online DDL that permits concurrent reads and writes for these index
 * types, but it still consumes I/O proportional to table size. Run it in a
 * low-traffic window. `php artisan brain:db-diagnostics` reports the row counts
 * and existing indexes to expect before you do.
 *
 * Every index below is prefixed hpb_ so it is unambiguous which system added it
 * and it can never collide with an ERP-chosen name.
