/**
 * Where a rule's root-cause family is DECLARED, when it can be declared at all.
 *
 * WHY THIS BELONGS ON THE RULE AND NOT ON THE SIGNAL. A root-cause family is a
 * fixed property of the CONDITION a rule detects, not a judgement about the
 * individual occurrence — the reasoning RiskAnalyzer already states for its own
 * generators: "a missing column is always an Information cause, a single person
 * carrying the work is always Capacity". Recording it per signal would invite a
 * different answer each run for the same rule, which is how a taxonomy stops
 * being reproducible. Recording it per rule makes it reviewable in one query and
 * changeable by an UPDATE rather than a deploy, exactly as `owner_role` and
 * `recommended_action` already are.
 *
 * BOTH COLUMNS ARE NULLABLE, WITH NO DEFAULT, AND THAT IS THE POINT.
 *
 * Most of the shipped rules detect a SYMPTOM whose cause is genuinely unknown —
 * a breached service target, a zone carrying more complaints than its share.
 * OperationalSignalRules already refuses to name a cause for the second in its
 * own code ("consistent with a network fault, but also with the zone simply
 * having more subscribers ... so it must not claim to"). A NOT NULL column, or
 * one with a default family, would force every such rule to assert a cause it
 * does not have, which is the fabrication this build exists to prevent. NULL
 * here means "this rule does not know why", and it must stay distinguishable
 * from any family a human has actually chosen.
 *
 * PLATFORM/TENANT PRECEDENCE IS INHERITED, NOT REIMPLEMENTED. Precedence on this
 * table is a read-time property of RuleEvaluator::rulesFor() — a row owned by the
 * tenant wins over the shared 'platform' row of the same rule_key, and the
 * existing UNIQUE (tenant_id, rule_key) is what keeps that unambiguous. Columns
 * added here are carried by whichever row wins, so a tenant may override the
 * family its industry ships with by inserting its own rule row, and needs no new
 * mechanism to do it.
 *
 * hypothesis_confidence is DECIMAL(6,4), matching hpbrain_hypotheses.confidence
 * and hpbrain_signal_rules.confidence. Bare NUMERIC becomes DECIMAL(10,0) on
 * MySQL and would round every value to an integer — 0.6 stored as 1 — the defect
 * 2026_08_04_000100_precision_on_decimal_columns was written to correct.
