/**
 * Record which rule raised a signal, in a column rather than inside JSON.
 *
 * The rule key was already being written, but only into the metadata blob. That
 * makes it unusable for the one question the detector has to ask on every run —
 * "have I already raised this?" — for two reasons:
 *
 *   1. It cannot be indexed usefully, and this lookup happens once per rule per
 *      tenant per hour.
 *   2. Reading it needs engine-specific SQL. JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(...))
 *      works on MySQL and MariaDB and does not exist on SQLite, so the query
 *      threw on the test database, was swallowed by the per-rule catch, and
 *      every rule silently counted as skipped.
 *
 * The metadata copy is left in place; it is what the UI already reads.
