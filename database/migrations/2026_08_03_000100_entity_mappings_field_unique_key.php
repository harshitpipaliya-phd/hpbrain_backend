/**
 * Correct the uniqueness rule on hpbrain_entity_mappings.
 *
 * THE BUG. 2026_08_01_000004_entity_mappings declares
 *
 *     UNIQUE (tenant_id, source_system, source_entity)
 *
 * while the table stores ONE ROW PER FIELD — source_field and universal_field
 * are singular columns, EntityMappingRepository::create() writes a row per
 * field, and list() orders by source_field. Those two facts cannot both hold:
 * the constraint permits exactly one row per (tenant, system, entity), so a
 * tenant could map exactly one field of Person and no more. Mapping Person's
 * eleven universal fields was structurally impossible.
 *
 * It was never hit because the table had zero consumers until EntityResolver.
 * The in-memory test schema declares no unique index at all, so the suite could
 * not have caught it either; that omission is corrected in BuildsBrainSchema
 * alongside this migration.
 *
 * THE REPLACEMENT, and why it is not merely the old key plus universal_field.
 *
 *     UNIQUE (tenant_id, universal_entity, universal_field)
 *
 * The resolver's contract is that a universal field resolves to exactly one
 * source column for a tenant. Keying on source_system would allow two systems
 * to both claim Person.email, and the resolver would have to pick one — silently
 * and arbitrarily. Forbidding that at the database is better than resolving it
 * in code, because the ambiguity is a configuration error and the only correct
 * response to it is to refuse the write.
 *
 * SAFETY. The table does not exist on the live shared database (hp_erp) — this
 * migration has never run there. Both steps are guarded by lookups, so running
 * against a database that has the table, lacks the old index, or already has
 * the new one is a metadata read and nothing else.
